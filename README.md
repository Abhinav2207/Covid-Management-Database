# Covid-Management-Database

## Introduction
This project is related to Covid vaccination drive currently going on in our
country. This database project is a simple replica of the backend of the CoWin
portal. It helps to keep track of the vaccination process by storing the information about vaccine manufacturing, transportation, the different vaccination centers and people who have been vaccinated.
